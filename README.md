# Home-Lab-SIEM
This repository documents the creation of a personal cybersecurity home lab. Using Oracle VirtualBox, I built a virtual network connecting a Splunk Enterprise SIEM to a vulnerable Metasploitable 2 VM.  This project's core purpose is to provide a hands-on environment for practicing essential security skills.
